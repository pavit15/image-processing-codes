# Image Processing MATLAB Codes

This repository contains all the experiment codes for basic **Image Processing**, implemented in **MATLAB**. Each experiment demonstrates a fundamental image processing concept using theoretical explanation, algorithm design, and practical code execution.

---

##  Repository Structure

Each experiment is organized into its own folder with:
-  `explanation.md`: Detailed theory, algorithm, and sample input/output.
-  MATLAB script for implementation.
-  Sample images (if applicable) and visual outputs.
